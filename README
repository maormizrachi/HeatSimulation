This project is a parallel ISL (Iterative Stencil Loops), that can solve a 13-points stencil.
The example coefficients is intended to mimic the heat spread, given an initial heat map.
The parallel executions are being done using MPI.

For compiling only, run `make`.
For reading the manual, run `make help`.
For generating an example, run `make example`.
For cleaning (except for output directories), run `make clean`.
